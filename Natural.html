<H3 align = "left"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Volcanic Eruptions :</H3></font>
<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Large volcanic eruptions can throw so much dust into the sky that the dust acts as a shield to solar radiation and causes a cooling trend in the atmosphere. You probably cannot remember such an
eruption as they are rare and infrequent occurences.</p></font>
<H3 align = "left"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Sunspots :</H3></font>
<p align = "Justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Changes in the Earth`s solar radiation levels can have some impact on the Earth`s climate. Increased solar activity can cause short-term warming cycles on the Earth.</p>
<H3 align = "left"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">The Wobbly Earth :</H3></font>
<p align = "Justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">As the Earth spins, it does not achieve perfect rotation. It actually wobbles slightly, thus alternately exposing the northern and southern latitudes to more and less solar radiation. This wobble in 
the Earth`s rotation has been causing changes in the temperature of the atmosphere for many millions of years.</p></font>
