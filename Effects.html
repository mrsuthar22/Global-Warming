<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">The U.S. Climate chane Science Program issued a report predicting an increase in extreme weather in North America, including both floods and droughts, as a result of global warming. There is 
strong evidence that heavy downpours will become more common and more severe along with the rise in global temperature.</p></font>
<H3 align = "left"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Droughts</H3></font>
<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Drought, condition of abnormally dry weather within a geographic region where some rain might usually be expected. A drought is thus quite different from a dry climate (See Climate), which designates
a region  that is normally, or atleast seasonally, dry.<br>
The term drought is applied to a period in which an unusual scarcity of rain causes a serious hydrological imbalance : Water-supply reservoirs empty, wells dry up, and crop damage ensues. The severity of the drought is gauged
by the degree of moisture deficiency, its duration, and the size of the area affected. If the drought is brief, it is known as a dry spell, or partial drought. A partial drought is usually defined as more than 14 days without appreciable
precipitation, whereas a drought may least for years.</p></font>
