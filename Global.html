<p align = justify><font face = "Calibri" font color = yellow font size = "+2">Global warming refers to the rising average temperature of Earth`s atmosphere and oceans and 
its projected continuation. In the last 100 years, Earth`s average surface temperature increased by about 0.8 *C (1.4 *F) with about two 
thirds of the increase occuring over just the last three decades. Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more 
than 90% certain most of it is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities auch as deforestation
and burning fossil fuel. These findings are recognized by the national science academics of all the major industrialized countries.<br>
Climate model  projections are summarized in the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC). They indicate that during the 21st century the global surface temperature is likely to rise a further  1.1  to 1.9 *C (2 to 5.2 *F)
 for their lowest emissions scenario and 2.4 to 6.4 *C (4.3 to 11.5 *F) for thier highest. [8] The ranges of these estimates arise from the
use of models with differing sensitivity to greenhouse gas concentrations.
