<p align = "left"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">The major cause of global warming is the emission of green house gases like carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide etc into the atmosphere. The
plants emit large amounts of carbon dioxide produced from burning of fossil fuels for the purpose of electricity generation. About twenty percent
of carbon dioxide emitted  in the atmosphere comes from burning of gasoline in the engines of the vehicles. This is true for most of the developed
countries. Buildings, both commercial and residential represent a larger source of global warming pollution than cars and trucks. Building of these 
structures require a lot of fuel to be burnt which emits a large amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Methane is more than 20 times as effectual
as CO<sub>2</sub> at entrapping heat in the atmosphere.<br>
Methane is obtained from resources such as rice paddies, bovine flatulence, bacteria  in bogs and fossil fuel manufacture. When fields are flooded, anerobic
situation buid up and the organic matter  in the soil decays, releasing methane to the atmosphere. The main sources of nitrous oxide include nylon and nitric 
acid production, cars with catalytic converters, the use of fertilizers in agriculture and the burning of organic matter. Another cause of global warming is
deforestation that is caused by cutting and burning of forests for the purpose of residence and industrialization.</p></font>

<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">A greeenhouse gas (Sometimes Abbreviated GHG) is a gas in an atmosphere that absorbs and emits radiation within the thermal infrared range.
This process is the fundamental cause of the greenhouse effect. The primary greenhouse gases in the Earth`s atmosphere are water vapour, carbondioxide, methane,
nitrous oxide, and ozone. In the Solar System, the atmospheres of Venus, Mars, and Titan also contain gases that cause greenhouse effects. Greenhouse gases greatly
affect the temperature of the Earth; without them, Earth`s surface would be on average about  33 *C (59 *F).</p></font>

<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Natural causes are causes created by nature. One natural cause is a release of methane gas from arctic tundra and wetlands. Methane is a greenhouse. A greenhouse gas is a gas that 
traps heat in the earth`s atmosphere. Another natural cause is that the earth goes through a cycle of climatic change. This climate change usually lasts about 40,000 years.</p></font> 
<H4><p align = "left"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2"><A Name = "MMC">Man Made Cause :</H4></p></font></A>
<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Man-made causes probably do the most damage. There are many man-made causes. Pollution is one of the biggest man-made problems. Pollution comes in many shapes ans sizes. Burning 
fossil fuels is one thing that causes pollution. Fossil fuels are fuels made of organic matter such as coal, or oil. When fossil fuels are burned they give off a green house gas called CO<sub>2</sub>. Also mining
coal and oil allows methane to escape. How does it escape? Methane is naturally in the ground. When coal or oil is mined you have to dig up the earth a little. When you dig up the fossil fuels you dig up the methane
as well. </p></font>

<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">The buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, mainly from your fossil fuel emissions, is the most significant human cause of global warming. Carbon dioxide is released every you burn something,
be it a car, airplane or coal plant. This means you must burn less fossil fuel if you want the Earth`s climate to remain stable! And unfortunately, we are currently destrying some of the best known mechanics for storing
that carbon plants.</p></font>

<p align = "justify"><font face = "Calibri" font size = "+2">Deforestation increases the severity of global warming as well. Carbon dioxide is released from the human conversion of forests and grasslands into farmlands and cities. All living plants store carbon. When those plants
die and decay, carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. As forests and grasslands are cleared for your use, enormous amounts of stored carbon enter the atmosphere.<p></font>
